# hello-world
## Skill Assessment
This repo contains a C# .NET project that was built to demonstrate my approach to a presented problem.

### The Requirement:
As a **user**, I want **return "Hello World"** so that **it can be written to the console/screen**

### Additional Details:
* The program should have an API that is separated from the program logic to eventually support mobile applications, web applications, or console applications, or windows services.
* The program should support future enhancements for writing to a database, console application, etc. 
  * Use common design patterns (inheritance, e.g.) to account for these future concerns
  * Use configuration files or another industry-standard mechanism for determining where to write the information to
* Write unit tests to support the API
